_In all my work, I endeavour to create meaningful impact._

Seasoned data scientist with deep experience in optimisation, algorithm design, cross-functional collaboration, and strategic applications of data science solutions to drive business and operational innovation across multiple domains.

Currently, I am a Senior Manager in American Express Innovation Laboratories, Singapore Decision Science Center of Excellence, working with Technology and Business stakeholders to solve Enterprise-wide problems, designing and implementing solutions at scale to deliver business impact.

Previously, I held a role as a Principal Data Science at Grab in Singapore, solving industry challenges in the field of supply chain and deliveries, through scalable optimisation and machine learning techniques as well as hypothesis-driven experiments.

Prior, I received my PhD from the Department of Industrial Systems Engineering & Management (ISEM), National University of Singapore (NUS) as a recipient of the NUS Research Scholarship.
My research interest is in the Ô¨Åeld of supply chain, logistics, and optimisation, employing a combination of operations research and simulation methods.
I was also involved in teaching as a graduate tutor at both undergraduate and graduate levels for courses in operations research, supply chain engineering, and programming methodology.
