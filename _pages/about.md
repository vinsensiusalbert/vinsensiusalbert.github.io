_In all my work, I endeavour to create a meaningful impact._

Seasoned data scientist with a deep experience in optimisation, algorithm design, cross-functional collaboration, and strategic applications of data science solutions to drive business and operational innovation across multiple domains.

I am currently a Principal Data Science at Grab in Singapore, solving industry challenges in the field of supply chain and deliveries, driving Southeast Asia forward, through scalable optimisation and machine learning techniques as well as hypothesis-driven experiments.

Prior, I received my PhD from the Department of Industrial Systems Engineering & Management (ISEM), National University of Singapore (NUS) as a recipient of the NUS Research Scholarship.
My research interest is in the Ô¨Åeld of supply chain, logistics, and optimisation, employing a combination of operations research and simulation methods.
I was also involved in teaching as a graduate tutor at both undergraduate and graduate levels for courses in operations research, supply chain engineering, and programming methodology.
