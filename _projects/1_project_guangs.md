At the height of the COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020, Singapore went into a lockdown (known as Circuit Breaker). Social interactions were limited, businesses are closed, and offices pivoted to "work from home". Essential services such as market and supermarkets remained open for business, but [access was limited](https://www.straitstimes.com/multimedia/in-pictures-circuit-breaker-period-extended-with-stricter-rules-in-place) with capacity limitation and contract tracing fully implemented and enforced.

Traditional market stalls suffered as foot traffic declined severely, while inventory still arrive but remain unsold, leading to food wastage. A market operator, Rachel Chia, had the idea to set up a e-commerce site to reach consumers at home in this time of need and difficulties.

From this was born [Guang's Fresh Mart](https://guangsfreshmart.com/) e-commerce page. I built the site on [Shopify](https://shopify.com.sg/) platform, and powered it with custom integration ranging from inventory tagging, invoicing for ground operations, Google calendar integration for scheduled deliveries, to Telegram bot integration for order notification and management.

While most of the implementation is internal-facing benefitting business processes, with this e-commerce site, traditional market merchants are able to reach out to consumers at home, and consumers are able to purchase fresh seafood and other produce online, at the comfort and safety of their homes. Food is no longer wasted, traditional market merchants are able to maintain their revenue streams, and consumers at home are able to obtain fresh produce. It's a win, win, win outcome from this project!
